- Only load the first "data" entry in "json/data.json" on load.

- After clicking the "Next Person" button, load the next sequential "data" entry, every time the button is clicked, until the final "data" entry is loaded.

- Clicking the "Next Person" button, after reaching the end of the "data" array, will trigger an alert that says "No more people!".
